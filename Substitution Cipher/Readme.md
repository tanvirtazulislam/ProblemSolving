Substitution Cipher


Problem Statement:

A substitution cipher is a method of encryption where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by another letter according to a fixed system. One of the simplest substitution ciphers is the Caesar cipher, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. You will be given a plaintext and a shift number. You will have to have to shift each letter of the plaintext according to the number.



Input
The program will take a string S and an integer N


Output
The output will print a string shifted by a particular number.



Examples:

1.

Input:
abcd 1
